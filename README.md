To change file permissions, use the command <code>chmod</code> (change mode). The owner of a file can change the permissions for user(u), group(g), or others(o) by adding (+) or subtracting (-) the read, write, execute permissions.

E.g: to add permission for everyone to execute a file:
```bash
chmod u+x filename
```
